  bio: Greg is a freelance web developer used to using Ruby for its expressiveness. He was looking for something faster, easier to scale, and with more intrinsic safety instead of requiring enormous amounts of unit tests. Yesod has been up to the challenge without throwing away the expressiveness he is used to. He used Yesod for eatnutrients.com and now spends time working with a startup using Yesod.

  bio:
         I'm a 26 year old Enterprise Resource Planning consultant and developer in Boston, MA. Stuck in a Windows world at work, I hack on open source code at home as my main hobby. A large part of this hobby is maintaining my personal web site which started as just static html with a few php helpers.


         Some time ago, I looked into converting this simple blog site to a framework. About that same time, I was being sucked into haskell thanks to the window manager XMonad. Finding Yesod gave me a great way to continue cutting my haskell teeth on something personal and productive.


         I enjoy working on Yesod because the framework is so rich, the development is so active, and the lead developer is about as accessible as it gets through email, blog comments, or github issues. The fact that a junior haskell developer like myself can roll in, get involved, and feel useful is a huge bonus as well.
