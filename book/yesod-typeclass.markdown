# Outline

* Purpose of site argument
* Used for settings
* Only approot needs to be overriden
* defaultLayout used by built in stuff (error messages, subsites, etc)
* Custom errorHandler example
* Sessions (encryptKey- horizontal scaling, clientSessionDuration)
* Logging with onRequest
* Some special features for static files (addStaticContent, urlRenderOverride)
* Auth stuff (isAuthorized, isWriteRequest, authRoute)
* Customize URLs (splitPath, joinPath, examples)

In the last chapter we showed some example Yesod applications and explained that the foundation datatype needed to be an instance of the Yesod typeclass. This typeclass is a central place to declare settings for your Yesod application. Besides approot, all of these settings are optional, but they

## Overriding defaultLayout

defaultLayout is a method of the Yesod typeclass, so you can simply provide an alternative implementation there. Yesod internally uses the defaultLayout method whenever possible: error messages, the built-in subsites, etc. This means that a lot of the built in features will automatically get styled like the rest of your site. A simple implementation is:

    defaultLayout widget = do
        PageContent title headTag bodyTag <- widgetToPageContent widget
        hamletToRepHtml [$hamlet|
        !!!
        %html
            %head
                %title $title$
                ^headTag^
            %body
                %h1 Our Website Banner
                %h2 And Our Silly Slogan
                ^bodyTag^
                %p And some footer with copyright information
        |]

The headTag variable will automatically have all of the CSS and Javascript declarations stated above. You can even introduce your own CSS and Javascript in the defaultLayout function:

    defaultLayout widget = do
        PageContent title headTag bodyTag <- widgetToPageContent $ do
            widget
            addStyle [$cassius|
            h1
                color: red
            |]
        hamletToRepHtml [$hamlet|...|]

<p class="advanced">There's actually much more to the embedding of CSS and Javascript than I have implied. By default, the raw code is inserted into your HTML via style and script tags. However, Yesod also has the ability to automatically create static files and serve the code externally. The site template created with the scaffolding tool does all of this for you.</p>

### getMessage

A common requirement in web applications is setting a message during one request and displaying it during another. For example, let's say you are logging into a site and type the wrong password. The application would like to show a message saying "invalid password" and allow you to type in your username/password again. There are basically two approaches to this:

1) In the handler that checks for a valid password, return a login form with the error message whenever an invalid password is submitted.

2) The handler that checks for a valid password redirects to the original login form when there is an invalid password.

At first glance option 1 sounds preferable, since it avoids an extra HTTP request. However, in general it's a good idea to avoid returning content from a POST request, since it can complicate back/forward button usage and make refreshing a page tricky. The problem with the second approach is that we need some way to tell the original login form page to display the error message.

Yesod provides a built in set of functions: getMessage and setMessage. We will cover these in more detail when discussing sessions, but for now it's enough to know that your defaultLayout should display the message returned by getMessage. Not only will this simplify your application code by just having to call getMessage once, but it will make interoperation with built-in Yesod features much better. A basic example would be:

    defaultLayout widget = do
        PageLayout title headTag bodyTag <- widgetToPageLayout widget
        mmsg <- getMessage
        hamletToRepHtml [$hamlet|
        !!!
        %html
            %head
                %title $title$
                ^headTag^
            %body
                $maybe mmsg msg
                    #message $msg$
                ^bodyTag^
        |]

# Summary

By using built-in Yesod constructs like defaultLayout and getMessage, you'll get a consistent look-and-feel throughout your site, including pages automatically generated by Yesod such as error pages and authentication.
