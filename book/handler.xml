    <title>Routing and Handlers</title>
    <intro>
        <p>If we look at Yesod as a Model-View-Controller framework, routing and handlers make up the controller. For contrast, let's describe two other routing approaches used in other web development environments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dispatch based on file name. This is how PHP and ASP work, for example.</li>
            <li>Have a centralized routing function that parses routes based on regular expressions. Django and Rails follow this approach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Yesod is closer in principle to the latter technique. Even so, there are significant differences. Instead of using regular expressions, Yesod matches on pieces of a route. Instead of having a one-way route-to-handler mapping, Yesod has an intermediate data type (called the route datatype, or a type-safe URL) and creates two-way conversion functions.</p>
        <p>Coding this more advanced system manually is tedious and error prone. Therefore, Yesod relies heavily on Template Haskell and Quasi-Quotation to automatically generate this code for you. This chapter will explain the syntax of the routing declarations, give you a glimpse of what code is generated for you, and explain the interaction between routing and handler functions.</p>

            <title>Pieces</title>

            <p>The first thing Yesod does when it gets a request (well, maybe not the <i>first</i>) is split up the requested path into pieces. The pieces are simply tokenized at all forward slashes. So:</p>

            <codeblock>toPieces "/" = []
toPieces "/foo/bar/baz/" = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]</codeblock>

            <p>You may notice that there are some funny things going on with trailing slashes, or double slashes ("/foo//bar//"), or a few other things. Yesod believes in having <term>canonical URLs</term>; if someone requests a URL missing a trailing slashes, or with a double slash, they get an automatic redirect to the canonical version. This follows the RESTful principle of one URL for one resource, and can help with your search rankings.</p>

            <p>What this means for you is that you needn't concern yourself with the exact structure of your URLs: you can safely think about pieces of a path, and Yesod automatically handles intercalating the slashes and escaping problematic characters.</p>

            <p>If, by the way, you want more fine-tuned control of how paths are split into pieces and joined together again, you'll want to look at the splitPath and joinPath methods in the Yesod typeclass.</p>

FIXME ~basics-names

On line 4 we declare a resource pattern named NameR. It has two "pieces" to it: the first is a static piece "name", while the second is a dynamic piece matching any String. Jumping down to line 6, we see that our handler function now takes a single argument: the name passed via the URL. So if you visit "/name/Michael/", Yesod will call the function getNameR with the argument "Michael".

Another nice thing here is that you aren't limited to Strings: if you use Int instead, Yesod automatically parses the appropriate piece of the URL into an integer for you and hands it to your handler function. If the piece is not a valid integer, the user will be served a 404 not found message.

    1 data MyApp = TypeSafe
    2 mkYesod "MyApp" [$parseRoutes|
    3 /             RootR GET
    4 /name/#String NameR GET
    5 /age/#Int     AgeR  GET
    6 |]

This is how we would create a new application with a site argument called MyApp and three resource patterns. If this style of Haskell looks unfamiliar to you, it's a combination of quasi-quotation and template haskell. You don't need to understand the details to use Yesod, but it is essentially letting us create a brand new language within Haskell to allow us to write concise, safe code.

This piece of code defines three resource patterns: RootR, NameR and AgeR. We've already seen how this interacts with the dispatch system: we will need to write handler functions getRootR, getNameR and getAgeR. What we **haven't** seen is that this also creates a data type:

    data MyAppRoute = RootR | NameR String | AgeR Int

As simple as this looks, it's one of the most powerful features Yesod offers for ensuring the safety of your applications. Every valid URL in our application can be expressed as a value of type MyAppRoute. Here are some mappings:

    /             -> RootR
    /name/michael -> NameR "michael"
    /age/935      -> AgeR 935

In Yesod, we don't splice together strings to generate URLs; we simply build up plain old Haskell data types. This means **the compiler can prevent invalid links**. This feature ties in very nicely with Yesod's templating system (Hamlet), as [we'll see later](../templates/).

As I mentioned, there is an associated type (type family) involved as well. This looks like:

    type instance Route MyApp = MyAppRoute

Understanding type families is not a prerequisite to using Yesod, though you may find it useful. Type families also play a big role in our persistence layer.

<hr>

Most of the code you write in Yesod lives within the Handler monad, so it's important to understand what it's doing. Monads have a reputation for being difficult to understand; if you are intimidated by monads, have no fear of this chapter (or of the Handler monad itself). You needn't have an understanding of monads to use them. In fact, my advice is to not bother trying to understand them at first. After usage, understanding follows.

Monads provide a method for encapsulating certain functionalities. There are a number of "standard" monads out there: reader provides some data which doesn't change, state provides data which can be changed, writer "logs" information, and error allows early termination of a function with a special return value. (Contrary to its name, the error monad doesn't need to be about errors.)

You can also create "monad transformer stacks", which combine a number of different monads together to encapsulate different types of functionalities together. For example, you might have a monad for interacting with a database: you could use a reader to keep the database connection, and writer to log query results, and error to exit early on database failure.

Handler is one such monad transformer stack. It uses a reader to track information on the request from the user, a writer for response headers to be sent back, error for special responses, and a few more pieces as well. As implied above, it's not important to understand **how** Handler works, but rather how to use it.

### There is no Handler

OK, I've been lying to you this whole time. Yesod does not actually export a datatype called Handler. Instead, it exports GHandler, which stands for "Generic Handler." When you use the scaffolding tool, a type synonym is created for you called Handler. If your **site argument** is called MyApp, then Handler is defined as:

    type Handler = GHandler MyApp MyApp

<p class="advanced">The reason MyApp needs to be specified twice has to do with subsites, an advanced topic we're going to ignore for the moment. Subsites actually pervade a lot of the design of Yesod, but you are shielded from this most of the time. We'll discuss subsites in a later chapter.</p>

For the remainder of this chapter, we'll assume that you have the Handler data type defined.

### Handler versus handler function

There are two very related terms: the Handler monad and a handler function. A handler function is a function called to generate a response to a request. A handler function always returns a value in the Handler monad. In fact, this value must be an instance of the HasReps typeclass which we have [discussed earlier](basics.html).

So to refer to our hello world example from before, the type signature for getHomeR:

    getHomeR :: Handler RepPlain

## Short circuiting

I mentioned that Handler includes error monad functionality. This allows it to **short circuit** the handler function, meaning to return a result immediately. There are a number of different short-circuiting responses; notFound is probably the simplest.

    getPersonR name = do
        if name == "michael"
            then return ()
            else notFound -- we only know one guy around here
        defaultLayout $ addBody $(hamletFile "michael")

As you might guess, notFound simply returns a 404 response. Other similar functions are permissionDenied and invalidArgs, which return 403 and 400 status codes, respectively. Their usage is similarly simple:

    postFireTheMissilesR target = do
        hasPrivileges <- canFireMissiles
        if hasPrivileges
            then return ()
            else permissionDenied "We don't let just anyone fire missiles."
        case target of
            "Romulans" -> fireTheMissiles Romulans
            "Klingons" -> fireTheMissiles Klingons
            _ -> invalidArgs ["Unknown target: " ++ target]

## Redirecting

Those previous three functions definitely count as error responses. In fact, the whole 4xx series of status codes are error codes. But I said at the beginning that the error monad works for things besides errors. So as not to disappoint, I introduce redirecting.

    getHomeR = do
        maybeUid <- maybeAuthId -- see if the user is logged in
        case maybeUid of
            Nothing -> defaultLayout $ addBody $(hamletFile "homepage")
            -- send a logged in user to his/her profile page
            Just uid -> redirect RedirectTemporary $ ProfileR uid


## FIXME taken from routing

Routing is the process of associating a requested URL to a handler function. In the "good ol' days" of CGI scripts, this was handled by file and directory names. There are *many* downsides to this approach; some simple ones are that it's difficult to pass in parameters via the URL, and therefore query strings tend to be abused, and that you have to write many smaller scripts instead of a single application. These same arguments apply to plain PHP and ASP pages.

Many modern frameworks use the approach of regular expressions. In these, you define the routing rules in a central place, and every request to the application gets routed through there. This is a huge step forward, but I'm sure many of you have heard this quote before:

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I'll use regular expressions.”  Now they have two problems.

In most cases of web development, all we care about are breaking a URL into pieces at each forward slash and routing based on the resulting list of strings. And this is exactly the approach Yesod takes. This chapter will have a little bit of overlap with some of the material in the [basics chapter](/book/basics/), but will go into more detail.

## Routes syntax

We've already seen routes declarations in previous chapters; let's have a little bit of a review:

    /              RootR     GET
    /name/#String  NameR     GET POST
    /age/#Int      AgeR      GET PUT

Each line in a routes declaration declares an individual **resource pattern**. Each line can be broken down into three parts: the pattern, the name and the routing information. The name is the simplest: it becomes the name of a constructor in the route data type (more on this later). By convention, route names end with a capital R, but you are free to ignore this convention.

The last part of the line is the routing information. In the examples above, it's a list of HTTP request methods that the resource pattern will respond to. This is what you'll use most commonly in Yesod. There are two other options: if you leave this blank, then you can respond to *all* request methods, and later we'll discuss how to use subsites.

For the moment, it's the pattern that we'd like to analyze. A pattern is broken down into pieces at each forward slash. RootR has no pieces, while NameR and AgeR each have two pieces. There are three types of pieces:

* A static piece is simply a word that matches literally.

* A single piece matches against one piece. It begins with a hash (#) and is followed by a data type. The data type must be an instance of the SinglePiece typeclass.

* A multi piece matches against the remainder of the pieces. It begins with an asterisk (*) and, like a single piece, is followed by a data type. The data type must be an instance of the MultiPiece typeclass.

The SinglePiece and MultiPiece typeclasses are simply provided for converting to and from String and [String], respectively. Their definitions are simple:

    class SinglePiece s where
        fromSinglePiece :: String -> Either String s
        toSinglePiece :: s -> String
    class MultiPiece s where
        fromMultiPiece :: [String] -> Either String s
        toMultiPiece :: s -> [String]

Converting *to* a String (or [String]) must always succeed, but the reverse is not true. This allows us to create instances for types like numbers. In fact, our example aboves exploits this with the AgeR resource pattern.

Multipiece might be a bit more elusive. A concrete example would be the pages of a wiki: we're allowed to have hierarchies of "nested folders" in the names of the pages, so we might define our routes as follows:

~routing-wiki

### Subsites

Subsites are an important concept in Yesod that allow us to create composible sets of pages that can be used in multiple sites. Some prime examples are included in Yesod itself: static files and user authentication. We'll cover more details later, but for now let's just see the syntax:

    /static StaticR Static getStatic

As before, the first part of the line is the pattern. With subsites, you can *only* use static pieces in the pattern; any dynamic parts of the URL must be handled by the subsite itself. In our case, we are setting up /static as the root of our new subsite. All URLs for that subsite will begin with /static. Also as before, the second word is the name of the resource pattern.

The last two words are important. The first is the datatype for the **subsite argument**. Just like a Yesod application has a site argument datatype, each subsite has its own datatype. This can be used to pass configuration settings. In the case of the static subsite, Static contains information on where to find the static files to be served.

The final word on the line is a function to get a subsite value from the master site value. All of this might be clearer with a little example:

~routing-static

## parseRoutes

Obviously, the syntax explained above for describing routes is not Haskell, and therefore can't be directly inserted into your source code. This is another place where Yesod uses **quasi-quotation** to allow the embedding of an arbitrary syntax. You've seen quasi-quotation [previously](/book/templates/) with Hamlet.

parseRoutes is provided by the web-routes-quasi package in the Web.Routes.Quasi.Parse module. It does two important things: it converts your routes definition into a value of type [Resource], and then checks if there are any overlapping routes. For example, the following routes would overlap, since /foo/bar would match them both:

    /foo/#String
    /#String/bar

If you would like to ignore the overlaps check and simply go with the first match, you can use the parseRoutesNoCheck function.

It's also possible to completely bypass the quasi-quoter and directly generate the list of resources. For example:

~routing-noquasi

## mkYesod

The last piece of the puzzle is that mkYesod function. It is actually a piece of Template Haskell that takes the name of the site argument and a list of resources and generates the following:

### Route datatype

Also known as the type-safe URL. If your site argument is called MyApp, the route datatype will be MyAppRoute. There will be a constructor for each resource pattern, with the name you specified. In the case of a subsite, that constructor will take a single argument: the route datatype for the subsite. Otherwise, there will be one argument to the constructor for each single and multi piece. For example:

    / HomeR GET
    /name/#String NameR GET
    /age/#Int AgeR GET
    /static StaticR Static getStatic
    /location/#City/#State LocationR GET
    /wiki/*WikiPage WikiR GET POST

will create a datatype:

    data MyAppRoute =
        HomeR
      | NameR String
      | AgeR Int
      | StaticR Static
      | LocationR City State
      | WikiR WikiPage

mkYesod also automatically creates a **type family instance** associating the site argument with the route datatype. In other words, it creates a synonym between:

    Route MyApp

and

    MyAppRoute

This can be useful for writing generic functions that work for multiple sites.

## YesodSite instance

There are three other pieces of information that we need to make this whole thing work:

* How to convert a URL to a value of the route datatype. This is *parsing* a route.

* How to convert a value of the route datatype to a URL. This is *rendering* a route.

* How to respond to requests on this URL. This is *dispatching* a route.

These three functionalities are combined into a Site datatype in the web-routes package. Yesod has a YesodSite typeclass to get the Site for a site argument. mkYesod also creates this instance.

## Splitting things up

It's great having all of this functionality in a single function, but this can also present a difficulty. Most handler functions will depend on the site argument datatype, and the YesodSite instance will depend on the handler functions. If we use the mkYesod function, we'll need to include all of the handlers and the call to mkYesod in the same file, which can be a bit unwieldy.

Yesod provides two additional functions: mkYesodData creates just the datatype and mkYesodDispatch creates the YesodSite instance. mkYesodData also creates a variable containing the list of routes so that you only need to declare your routes once.

The site template created by the scaffolding tool automatically sets up the calls to mkYesodData and mkYesodDispatch appropriately.

## Conclusion

A defining feature of Yesod is type-safe URLs. A common deterrent to creating such a robust system is the boilerplate and clumsiness of creating a datatype, parse, render and dispatch functions that are all consistent. By using code generation, Yesod makes this powerful feature easily accessible.

We have not yet fully covered the concept of subsites referenced in this chapter; the full concept will take a chapter of its own. For the moment, hopefully you'll be able to get started using some of the subsites built into Yesod.
